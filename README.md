# NeuralC

NeuralC is a C project that implements Multilayer Artificial Neural Network, without relying on any neural network libraries. ~~It is designed to be easy to use, and to be fast.~~

It may not be easy to use, and it's definitely not fast.

- activation functions: sigmoid, tanh, relu, leaky relu,
- loss functions: mean squared error, cross entropy,
- layers: dense, convolution, max pooling,
- optimizers: gradient descent, momentum, rmsprop, adam

To do list:

- [ ] layer.c
- [ ] model.c
- [ ] backprop.c
- [ ] example: mnist

To do list:

- [ ] Add more activation functions : softmax, elu, selu, softplus, softsign, hard_sigmoid, linear
- [ ] Add more loss functions
- [ ] Add more layers : dropout, flatten, batch normalization
- [ ] Add more examples
- [ ] Add more tests
